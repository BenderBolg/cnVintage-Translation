1
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:13,230
Last month one of my fans sent me a Penultimate cartridge.
上个月我的一个粉丝给我寄了张Penultimate卡带

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,090
This is a modern-day cartridge for the Commodore
VIC-20 and it does a lot of different things.
这是一张当今爱好者自制的VIC-20卡带，拥有许多不同的功能

3
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,110
So in this episode you're going to be seeing
a lot about the VIC-20.
所以在这一集你将看到很多关于VIC-20的东西

4
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,110
And why not?
为什么不呢

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,180
This computer holds a special place for me
because it was the first computer I ever owned
这台电脑对于我来说有一些特殊的意义

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,060
when I was six years old.
因为它是我在6岁的时候所拥有的第一台电脑

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,300
And I think a lot of the time it is completely
overshadowed by the Commodore 64.
但是我觉得很多时候Commodore 64夺走了很多本来它应有的风光

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,090
So it doesn't get nearly the attention it
deserves in the world of retro computers.
总之，作为一台古董电脑，它并没有引起人们的注意

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,150
There's so much I want to say about this computer,
but I'm going to have to restrain myself because

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,190
I’m actually scripting out a full and complete
episode, very detailed, on this computer.
关于这台电脑我有很多想说的，但是因为我在单独准备一期关于它的视频，所以这集我就少说点吧

11
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:54,390
But, for the time being, suffice it to say,
it was a fairly successful gaming platform
眼下，只要说它是一个有超过300个游戏可用，相当成功的游戏平台就够了

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,470
with over 300 games available for it.

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,980
That's more games than the ColecoVision, the
Intellivsion, the Atari 5200 or 7800, the
它比 Coleco Vision, Intellivsion, Atari 5200 or 7800, Sega 游戏机 ， TRS-80 彩色电脑
，turbo-graft 16等平台拥有更多的游戏

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:09,110
Sega game gear or the TRS-80 color computer,
or even the turbo-graft 16, and many others.

15
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,100
And from a hardware perspective, as a gaming
machine what was the competition like in 1980?
那么从硬件的角度来看，上世纪80年代的游戏机行业竞争是什么样的呢？

16
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,700
I mean, you had the Apple II and the Atari
400 and 800 machines, The Intellivision, the
市面上有苹果II，Atari 400和800的游戏机，Intellivision, Color Computer，VIC-20和 Atari 2600 

17
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,149
TRS-80 Color Computer, the VIC-20 and the
Atari 2600.

18
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:27,969
That was essentially the gaming market in
1980.
这基本上就是1980年的游戏市场

19
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:35,039
So, the Apple II was $1,298 just for the machine,
but honestly if you were going to play any
苹果II的售价是1298美元 但老实说，如果你要玩任何游戏，都必须从磁带或者软盘中载入，所以你得花更多的钱

20
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:40,380
games they'd have to load from tape or more
likely disk, so you'd have to spend even more

21
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,380
money.

22
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,460
And if you wanted a display you'd need to
buy a monitor or buy a separate RF modulator
如果需要显示输出，那你就需要买显示器或买一个单独的射频调制器

23
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,590
for your TV.

24
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,329
So getting into an Apple II was a considerable
expense, and it still had no sound synthesizer
所以，入一个苹果II的费用是相当可观的，而且它还没有用于游戏的声音合成器

25
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,369
for games.

26
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,889
The Atari 400 was a more reasonable proposition
at $440 and could play cartridge games like
Atari 400是一个更合理的选择，售价440美元，可以像真正的游戏机一样玩卡带游戏

27
00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:00,399
a real game machine.

28
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,860
So this would have been serious competition.
所以本应是一场激烈的竞争

29
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,009
The Intellivision was priced competitively
at $299, but it was just a game machine, not
Intellivision的价格是299美元，但它只是一台游戏机，而不是一台电脑

30
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,019
a computer.

31
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:15,610
The TRS-80 Color computer was barely competitive
at $399, but it had that annoying chicklet
售价为399美元的TRS-80彩色电脑几乎没有什么竞争力，因为它有着讨厌的Chicklet键盘

32
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,750
keyboard and really a lack of any brand-name
commercial game titles since it was only sold
也没有什么大牌的商业游戏 另外还只在Radio Shack销售

33
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,150
in Radio Shack and they didn't allow selling
anything in the store back then with names
还不允许和Atari、Activision或者Parker Brothers的机子放在一家店里销售

34
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,260
like Atari, Activision, or Parker Brothers
on the labels.

35
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:35,180
The VIC-20 itself sold for $299, and the only
other serious competing game platform of the
VIC-20本身的售价为299美元

36
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,730
day would have been the Atari 2600, which
was sold at a good price, but was alread
而唯一可以竞争的游戏平台是Atari 2600

37
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,080
out of date and the VIC-20 beat it in both
graphics and sound, plus it was a real computer.
但是已经过时了，而VIC-20在图形和声音又是直接秒杀，再加上它又是一台真正的计算机

38
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,900
So, now that I've set the stage of the VIC-20
as a gaming platform, you are about to see
我现在已经说明了VIC-20作为一台游戏机的背景

39
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,260
a LOT of games.
接下来你也即将看到大量的游戏

40
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,440
Because the penultimate cartridge is crammed
full of games.
因为Penultimate卡带就是塞满了游戏

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,460
You might be able to compare it to one of
these all-in-one cartridges for the Nintendo.
你也许能把它和任天堂的那种多合一卡带相比较

42
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,540
But the penultimate cartridge is also quite
a bit more than just a games cartridge, which
但是Penultimate卡带不单单只是一张游戏卡带

43
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,680
I’m going to get into after I show you the
games.
别的东西等我展示完游戏再介绍

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,580
For the moment, let’s talk about the games!
现在我们还是先来谈谈游戏吧

45
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,710
There’s 40 of them in here!
里面一共有40个游戏

46
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,910
Let me help you visualize what that many VIC-20
cartridges would look like.
让我给你展示一下一般VIC-20卡带的样子

47
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,010
By the way, almost all of the games for the
VIC-20 were, in fact, distributed on cartridge
顺便说一下，事实上几乎所有在VIC-20上运行的游戏都是从卡带上载入的

48
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,650
because it had so very little on board memory.
因为VIC-20它的内存很少

49
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,400
OK, so I'm going to insert this beast into
the computer.
好了，准备插上电脑

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,500
By the way, VIC-20 games are notoriously difficult
to insert, but on the bright side they almost
顺便说一句，VIC-20游戏的插入很费劲，但是另一方面，

51
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,900
never have issues with making good contact.
接触就从来不成问题

52
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,310
I've never seen anyone having to blow into
a VIC-20 cartridge!
我从来没见过有人需要往VIC-20的卡带里吹气

53
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,460
I'll also connect a joystick since the vast
majority of these games require one.
这些游戏大部分都需要用到手柄，我也将它连了上去


54
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,780
This is the perfect cartridge to just hook
up your VIC-20 to the living room TV and just
如果你想把的客厅电视和VIC-20连接起来，然后坐下来用手柄操作的话

55
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,990
sit back with a joystick.
那这张卡带非常合适

56
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,630
You don’t need a disk drive or any other
clutter, just like a game console.
你不需要再用一个磁盘驱动器或者其他麻烦的东西 就像一台主机一样就可以了

57
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,270
The first thing you'll see on power up is
a menu.
首先打开来你会看到一个菜单

58
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,540
You can use your joystick to scroll through
the list of games.
你可以用你的手柄滚动游戏菜单

59
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,080
You can also use the cursor keys to jump entire
screens and then type the number of the game
也可以使用键盘实现屏幕光标的跳转，然后输入你想要的游戏的编号

60
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,610
you want.

61
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,460
Ok, so I’m just going to take these one
by one in the order they appear, starting
好吧，那我就拿这些按他们出现的顺序，逐一开始玩

62
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,460
with Aggressor.
第一个是Aggressor

63
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,900
Now, I’ll be honest, I’ve never seen this
game before.
老实说，之前我从没见过这个游戏

64
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,440
It appears to be some sort of Defender clone.
看起来像是克隆版的Defender

65
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,699
And I guess visually, it looks okay.
看起来我觉得看起来不错

66
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:24,790
I looked it up and saw that this was an early
game by Jeff Minter, or Jeff Minter, I’m
我查了一下，是Jeff Minter早期的一个游戏

67
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:30,320
not sure how to pronounce that, who later
also founded Llamasoft.
并不清楚如何发音 他之后还创办了Llamasoft

68
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,960
The next game is Amazing Maze, and unfortunately
this game doesn’t really get my blood pumping
下一个游戏是Amazing Maze，不幸的是这个游戏也没有让我感到热血澎湃

69
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
either.

70
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,610
I’m honestly surprised it was included.
我甚至于很惊讶它被包括在内

71
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,860
Next up is Avenger.
再下一个游戏是Avenger（复仇者)

72
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,139
Ok, if it isn’t obvious, this is definitely
a space-invaders clone.
好吧，这肯定是我以前从没见过的太空入侵者克隆游戏

73
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,120
And I’ve actually never seen it before until
now.

74
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,330
Normally, I am not a big fan of clone games,
but in the case where the original game is
通常来说，虽然我并不喜欢山寨游戏，但是在这个游戏根本没有在这个平台上发布的情况下

75
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,300
not available on a platform, a good clone
is okay in my opinion.
我觉得好的山寨也是可以接受的

76
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,699
And this is exactly the case here, as space
invaders was not available on the VIC-20 or
这就是这里的情况，并不存在VIC-20或C64版的太空入侵者

77
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:03,430
C64.

78
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,289
This clone is actually really well made, right
down to the bases, the aliens, and the little
这个克隆游戏真的很好，完全还原了基地，外星人，还有能看见的偶尔碰到的小飞碟在空中飞过

79
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:09,289
flying saucer that sometimes comes across
the top.

80
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:14,669
So, definitely a great game to be included
here.
因此，这绝对是一个被包括在内的好游戏了

81
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:19,289
Next up is Battlezone, which everyone is already
probably familiar with.
接下来是战争地带，或许每个人都已经对此很熟悉

82
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:22,550
This is one of the first first-person shooter
type games.
这是第一批第一人称射击游戏之一

83
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,169
This version is a bit blocky on the graphics,
but seems playable enough, however I must
这个游戏版本图形感觉分辨率低了点 但是也可以玩了

84
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:30,039
admit I’ve never really been fond of this
game.
但我必须承认我从来没有真正喜欢过这个游戏

85
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,759
Here’s centipede.
再是centipede

86
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,870
This is another official Atari licensed version.
这是另一个Atari官方授权的版本

87
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:41,639
And it seems fairly true to the original arcade,
I have no complaints about this game!
这像是真实的原始接机游戏，我对这个游戏没有什么不满意的地方

88
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,189
Next up is Choplifter.
接下来是Choplifter

89
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:46,889
I actually used to play the C64 version of
this game as a kid.
我小时候其实还玩过这个游戏的C64版本

90
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,199
It turns out the VIC-20 version is almost
identical in game play, with just slightly
结果是 VIC-20的版本在游戏体验上基本上和C64的是一致的

91
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,860
chunkier graphics.
只是图形方面分辨率稍微低了点

92
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,259
I accidentally hit one of the function keys
when I started playing that changed the foreground
另外我在玩的时候不小心碰到了一个功能键

93
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,259
color.
发现可以更改游戏的背景颜色

94
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,279
So let me pick a different color.
来选个不同的颜色

95
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:03,900
Believe It or not, that is a common feature
on a lot of old VIC-20 games, that you can
而且其实很多老的VIC-20游戏都支持修改背景颜色

96
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,039
change the foreground color since many of
the games operate essentially as monochrome
因为很多这些游戏本质上也就是一个黑白游戏

97
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,309
games with some different colored background
areas.
然后加上点不同颜色的背景区域

98
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:18,400
So I’m going to rescue my guys here and
try to get away before that tank shoots me!
所以我要在坦克射击我之前营救出同伴并离开这里

99
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,370
OK, so this is defender.
Defender就是这样了

100
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,460
I showed a clone of this a few minutes ago
called Aggressor, but this is the officially
几分钟之前我才展示过一个叫Aggressor的clone

101
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,960
licensed version here.
但是这个是官方授权的版本

102
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,979
I’m not sure which is best.
我也不确定哪个比较好

103
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,849
I also find it ironic that one is called defender
and the other is called aggressor.
而且有趣的是一个叫Defender（防御者）另外一个叫Aggressor（入侵者）

104
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:36,930
Anyway, not much to really talk about on this
one, so on to the next.
无论如何，没什么太多可讲的，下一个

105
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,020
This is Demon Attack.
这个是Demon Attack

106
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,389
I’ve never played this game until today.
我之前从来没玩过这个游戏

107
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,340
And it seems pretty obvious how to play it,
it’s sort of like space invaders or Galaga
玩法还是相当清晰明了的 就有点像Space Invaders或者Galaga

108
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,340
maybe.

109
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,710
But for some reason it isn’t really gripping
me much, so I’m going to move on to the
但出于某些原因，我并没有什么大兴趣

110
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,240
next.

111
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,949
Next up is Dig Dig, and it should need no
explanation.
下一个是Dig dig，这个应该不需要过多解释了

112
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:57,690
The gameplay here is pretty true the arcade.
游戏体验和真的接机差不多的

113
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,409
As expected with this machine, the graphics
are a bit chunky, but that doesn’t make
正如和对机能的预计一样 图形效果就差了点

114
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:03,830
it any less enjoyable to play!
不过毫不影响游戏性

115
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,059
Next up is Donkey Kong.
下一个是Donkey Kong

116
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:09,400
So, this is an officially licensed Nintendo
game for the VIC-20.
这个是任天堂官方授权的VIC-20版本

117
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,559
Most of the games I’ve shown so far have
been Atari games.
到目前为止我展示过的大部分游戏都是Atari游戏

118
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:16,789
So you get to see the character of Mario and
Princess Peach here, although I don’t think
可以看见马里奥和Peach公主

119
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:19,569
they had been officially named at this point
in history.
虽然我觉得这个时候他们应该还没有被正式命名

120
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:24,039
I don’t have a top 10 games list for the
VIC-20, but I probably should make one.
我还没有排过VIC-20的Top10游戏列表，或许我应该列一个

121
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,770
But if I did, this game would definitely be
on the list.
如果真做的话 那这个肯定是上榜游戏

122
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,009
I think it’s one of the most well-made games
for the system.
我觉得这应该是这个平台上制作最精良的游戏之一

123
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:33,630
I would also like to point out some of the
challenge in producing a game like this on
另外考虑到这个系统没有硬件精灵 单元颜色也受限

124
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:38,619
a system that has no sprites and colors confined
to little cells on the screen.

125
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:42,550
Most of these games are really impressive
from a programming standpoint.
这些游戏从编程角度来说都算是非常惊人了

126
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,529
So this is the official port of Frogger from
Parker Brothers.
这个是来自Parker Brothers的Frogger的官方移植

127
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:49,839
While this game is playable enough, it is
clear the programmers on this one were a bit
虽然可玩度也不错 但是显然这里的程序员有点点偷懒

128
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,559
lazy or perhaps less creative than some of
these other games I’ve shown, as you can
或者说创意不足

129
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:58,090
see black squares around everything, a sure
sign they are just moving characters around
可以看见东西附近的黑色方块 说明他们只是在屏幕上移动字符

130
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,080
on the screen in a grid rather than trying
to move anything pixel by pixel.
而不是一个像素一个像素的复制

131
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,069
And here’s the official port of Galaxian
from Atari and you can clearly see the objects
这个是Atari官方移植的Galaxian

132
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:10,309
move much smoother, pixel by pixel.
显然里面的东西是逐像素点移动的了

133
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:12,789
So again, some great work went into this.
这张卡带里确实还是有不少良作的

134
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:15,389
And this is a great port of the game, in my
opinion.
在我看来，这个移植也非常不错

135
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:20,539
You can even hear they made good use of all
of the voices on the sound chip too.
甚至可以听到他们也是充分利用了音源芯片的各个声部

136
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,509
Next up is Gorf, and this is an officially
licensed port.
下一个是Gorf，也是官方授权移植

137
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:30,569
And it’s pretty decent except for the movement
of the aliens.
除了外星人的移动外，相当不错

138
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:32,320
Next game is Jelly Monsters.
下一个游戏是Jelly Monsters（水果怪物）

139
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,880
I’ve never actually played or even heard
of this game.
我也是之前从来没有听说过这个游戏

140
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,710
Apparently it can be played with the keyboard
or joystick.
键盘或者摇杆都可以操作

141
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,979
This is obviously a Pacman clone.
显然是个山寨版的Pacman（吃豆人）

142
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,390
And you know, it’s not bad really.

143
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,790
The movement on this game is so fluid I could
almost forget the machine has no sprites,

144
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,770
except when you see two objects of different
colors get close you can see the color-cell

145
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,770
clash.

146
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,620
But I can’t fault the programmers, as that’s
a hardware limitation.

147
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,670
Next on the list is Jungle Hunt.

148
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,120
I am not going to lie, I’ve never been a
fan of this game on any platform.

149
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,190
And so it’s hard to really judge it here
because I hate the game one way or another.

150
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,100
Sorry, I’m biased but at least I admit it.

151
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,940
And here’s Jupiter Lander.

152
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,500
Admittedly, I’ve never played this and I
can’t quite figure it out.

153
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,380
I thought it would be similar to lunar lander
but the controls don’t seem to make any

154
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,380
sense.

155
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,890
Besides, how would you land on Jupiter in
the first place since it is a gas giant?

156
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,780
OK, so here we have Lode Runner, I think the
first Broderbund game I’ve seen on here.

157
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,590
I’m not a huge fan of this game, but I see
a lot of love for this game over on the Apple

158
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,720
II Facebook page, so I’m curious what they
think of this port.

159
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,840
I mean, it seems decently well made.

160
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,700
Next up is Lunar Leeper, by Sierra Online
in 1981.

161
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,470
Admittedly, I didn’t know Sierra ever made
any VIC-20 games, I guess I was wrong.

162
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,070
Anyway, I’ve never played this game before
either.

163
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,270
And at fist I wasn’t even sure which creature
I was supposed to be playing.

164
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,760
I saw the little leaping critters so I thought
with a name like Lunar Leeper, that I’d

165
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
be playing the leeper.

166
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,690
But, apparently I move the flying saucer.

167
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,570
The animation is really smooth and I think
one of the reasons they were able to do that

168
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,770
is they are just treating the play area like
a monochrome bit-mapped screen.

169
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:16,580
However, I can’t quite figure out how to
play this, so I’m going to move on.

170
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,400
OK, so now we have Monster Maze.

171
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,740
It’s a first person maze program, it’s
a little hard to navigate as I seem to run

172
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,750
into walls faster than I expect.

173
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,590
And the whole game clearly runs in text mode,
just using various line characters.

174
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,270
But, it actually looks pretty decent, despite
that.

175
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:38,850
Still, I couldn’t quite master the game
play, I think I’d need to read the manual.

176
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,580
Next up is Moon Patrol.

177
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,890
This game looks better than the Atari 2600
version, but that’s about it.

178
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,490
The animation is pretty smooth, which again
on the VIC-20 is always a challenge due to

179
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,960
lack of sprites.

180
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,500
It is one of the few VIC-20 games with a sound
track, although the music is just on one voice

181
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,100
and the sound effects are on the other voices.

182
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:03,910
So, while I am not a big fan of the official
Pac-Man port, I think they did a much better

183
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,840
job with Ms. Pac-Man.

184
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,490
The game looks kind of blocky compared to
other systems, due to the low resolution on

185
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,370
this system, but otherwise this game plays
really well and I would definitely include

186
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:20,370
it in my top 10 games list for the VIC-20.

187
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,490
This is another Jeff Minter game called Attack
of the Mutant Camels.

188
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,870
So at this point we’re already seeing his
love for Camels and Llamas.

189
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,620
I don’t know if I’m playing grid runner
of centipede.

190
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,840
I don’t see anything that actually looks
like a camel, but that’s probably due to

191
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,780
the low resolution.

192
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,060
Next up is Omega Race.

193
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,800
This game is sort of special to me because
it’s the first cartridge game I ever owned

194
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
for the VIC-20 back in 1982.

195
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,010
I’ve only ever seen this game on the VIC-20
and Commodore 64, but apparently it was first

196
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,610
an arcade and was also available on the Atari
2600 and the Coleco.

197
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,960
I always felt the game was sort of like playing
asteroids, but a little more involved.

198
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,370
And one of the things I learned early on was
that it was best to move only in one dimension

199
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,870
and try to shoot the aliens..

200
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,750
The moment I started moving the ship in a
second dimension, I’d always crash into

201
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,750
something.

202
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,120
This game is essentially monochrome, other
than the title screen.

203
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,170
It’s possible the original arcade may have
been a vector based CRT like asteroids, which

204
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,790
would explain the monochrome choice.

205
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,290
Anyway, I spent many hours of my childhood
playing this.

206
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,950
OK, so next on the list is the official Pac
Man port from Atari.

207
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,450
To be honest, it isn’t all that great, although
I guess it’s definitely better than the

208
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,890
Atari 2600 version.

209
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,150
So, moving on.

210
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,060
Let’s have a look at Pharaohs Curse.

211
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,870
This is another one I’ve never heard of
until now.

212
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,980
The game reminds me of Montezuma’s Revenge.

213
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,210
And it’s definitely a game that would require
some practice to ever get very far, but it

214
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,180
looks like it could be fun.

215
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,610
On to the next.

216
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,740
So this is the official Pole Position from
Namco.

217
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,270
There’s not really a lot for me to say here.

218
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,550
I mean, the game looks and plays fine considering
the limitations of the system.

219
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,740
But for some reason, I just don’t find it
to be any fun.

220
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,740
And..

221
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,570
Here’s the official port of Q*Bert for the
VIC-20.

222
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:16,260
Unfortunately, I have nothing good at all
to say about this port.

223
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,120
Not only does Q*Bert not move..

224
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,000
I mean he just sort of appears on the next
cube almost like he teleports around instead

225
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,510
of jumps.

226
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,320
But there are black squares around the characters.

227
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,940
This is because the game essentially runs
in text-mode and they’ve just re-defined

228
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,060
some of the characters.

229
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,300
I think this may actually be the worst port
of Q*Bert on any system.

230
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,780
Now, don’t get me wrong.

231
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,760
I understand the limitations of this machine
and there’s a lot of problems to overcome

232
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,500
not having any sprites, especially with the
diagonal lines crossing through color cell

233
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
areas.

234
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,180
But, even if they had to make the game monochrome,
I would have preferred some animation over

235
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,280
the extra color.

236
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,070
Anyway, rant over, onto the next.

237
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:01,230
This is Radar Rat Race, which is unique to
the VIC-20 and the Commodore 64.

238
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,870
The game is obviously a rip off of Rally X,
but I always sort of liked the little rats

239
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,880
chasing after the cheese and avoiding the
cats.

240
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,410
The game is ridiculously simple from a technical
level, and this would be super easy to code.

241
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:19,570
But oddly enough, this was a decently fun
game from my childhood.

242
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,600
Next up is Robotron 2084.

243
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,840
I never actually cared much for this game,
I think I preferred Berzerk, which had a similar

244
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,880
type of gameplay.

245
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,310
This is Shamus, a game I’ve never heard
of.

246
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,640
I kept waiting to see Alfred Hitchcock walk
across the screen or something.

247
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,830
Anyway, This seems to be another sort of Berzerk
or Robotron type game, although the graphics

248
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,960
are a little more interesting in this one.

249
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,820
Next up is Star Battle, another one I have
never played before.

250
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:53,540
It is most definitely a Galaxian clone, although
I definitely prefer the official Galaxian

251
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,420
port over this one.

252
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,350
I tried playing Submarine Commander, but I
honestly couldn’t figure out how it works

253
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,240
so I’d need to find the manual and read
it, I suppose.

254
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,410
Super Slots is pretty much what it sounds
like.

255
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:16,720
And there’s not a lot I can say about it,
other than it’s a lot machine.

256
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,780
Next up is Threshold, and it’s another Sierra
Online game made back in 1981.

257
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:26,000
I’ve never played this before, but I still
get the sense this is another Galaxian or

258
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,540
space invaders clone and it’s just not gripping
me.

259
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,860
Next up is Tutankham.

260
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,600
I hope I’m saying that correctly.

261
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,640
Never played this one.

262
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,410
The game looks kind of interesting, but I
definitely need some practice to get very

263
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:47,160
far with this.

264
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,710
So the last 4 games on this cartridge are
all Scott Adams adventure games.

265
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,620
These were quite popular back in the 80s on
a variety of computer platforms.

266
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,780
These are just text games, and so the gameplay
is going to be pretty similar regardless of

267
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,940
which computer platform you play them on,
so there’s not a lot really to show here.

268
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,630
OK, so now that I’ve covered the games..
and by the way, there’s a lot more games

269
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,779
for the VIC-20 than what was on the cartridge,
but I do think that most of the best games

270
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,850
for the platform were on here.

271
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,460
But what else does the cartridge do?

272
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,790
Well, for one thing it adds more memory.

273
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:23,530
So, you know the original VIC-20 only had
5K of RAM, only 3 and a half available to

274
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,840
the user.

275
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:31,250
Commodore officially sold 3K, 8K, and 16K
RAM upgrade cartridges and they also had the

276
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,529
super expander which was 3K with an enhanced
BASIC to go along with it.

277
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:40,560
I did a whole episode on that one, but anyway,
the penultimate cartridge can upgrade the

278
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,250
VIC-20 all the way to 35K.

279
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,940
Plus it has a menu driven system do allow
you to pick a variety of memory banking configurations,

280
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,470
that some software would require.

281
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,860
So, I’ve shown you a bunch of older games,
but what about newer games?

282
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,210
Yes, people are actually still writing new
games for the old VIC-20.

283
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,150
Myself, included.

284
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:06,669
Back in 2009, I actually wrote as an experiment
game called Planet-X1, Ironically, I’ve

285
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:12,199
never actually seen the game work on a real
VIC-20 because I wrote it on an emulator and

286
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:18,470
the game requires 32K of RAM, which I didn’t
have a 32K Ram expansion card before.

287
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,150
Well, now I can, so now I’m going to play
the game on a real VIC-20 and see if it works.

288
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:28,140
So, how do I get the game over, well I have
one of these SD-2-IEC adapters, which works

289
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,059
on any Commodore machine, including the VIC-20.

290
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:35,561
Oh, and guess what, the penultimate cartridge
actually supports this device directly, as

291
00:17:35,561 --> 00:17:37,010
you can see right here on the menu.

292
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,840
So, let’s give it a try.

293
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,430
So this is a directory of what’s on my SD
card.

294
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,520
Most of these are C64 games.

295
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,750
Anyway, here’s planet X1.

296
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,940
So you can see I wrote this in 2009, and that’s
my old yahoo email, I don’t even use that

297
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,520
address anymore.

298
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,320
By the way, this is actually just text characters,
I wanted this game to all fit in RAM and there

299
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,580
wasn’t enough room for a lot of fancy bit-mapped
screens.

300
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,770
So even the main menu here is just colorful
text characters.

301
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,260
So I’m going to have it generate a random
map, this actually takes a little while.

302
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,320
This is likely the only real-time strategy
game ever made for the VIC-20.

303
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,370
Somebody sent me a screen capture from their
cell phone, by the way, where apparently this

304
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,970
game was shown on screen of the TV show halt
and catch fire sometime in season 2.

305
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,300
But I haven’t watched the whole season yet
so I haven’t figured out which episode it

306
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,300
was from.

307
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,300
Anyway, it looks like one of the enemy bases
ended up right next to me, so I’m going

308
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,650
to blow his base to kingdom come before he
has a chance to build anything.

309
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,630
So now you can see the enemy number has reduced
to two.

310
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,410
So I’ll need to scout around the map and
find the other two.

311
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,160
And wouldn’t you know it, I ran my tank
right off into the lava.

312
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,020
I still have one tank left so I’ll switch
to that one, and go see what I can find.

313
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,150
Now, while I’m searching for the other bases,
they will start generating enemy fighters

314
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:59,100
which will come looking for my base, so time
is sort of the essence here.

315
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:04,120
The map is really big and so it could take
a while.

316
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,590
And well, crap, I just lost my second tank.

317
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,000
The game is eventually over, even though I
never really added any code to end the game.

318
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,490
So, I never actually finished coding Planet
X1.

319
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,370
It was really going to do a lot more things
than it ended up doing.

320
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,250
It was more of an experiment really, and at
the time I made it back in 2009 there seemed

321
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,550
to be zero interest in the game.

322
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,680
So I just kind of finished it up to the point
I was satisfied that it completed my experiment.

323
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,530
But, for those that are interested, it is
available free for download on my website.

324
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,370
I was also sent this game on cassette tape
to review.

325
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,440
It’s called Pentagorat and it’s distributed
on cassette tape.

326
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,330
But notice it says is requires a VIC-20 +
32K of RAM.

327
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,180
I know that’s a little hard to see.

328
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,480
Anyway, so I should be able to use it with
the penultimate cartridge.

329
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:58,540
So heck, I’ll just give it the maximum 35K
and see how it works.

330
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:07,410
OK, so they’ve given us a little fast loader
system with a countdown, which is nice because

331
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,610
most games just sit there saying loading and
you don’t know if it is even working or

332
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,610
not.

333
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,630
Oh wow..

334
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,390
This is definitely the nicest loader screen
I’ve ever seen on a VIC-20 game.

335
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:24,850
It’s actually amazing that they can do all
this while still loading the game too.

336
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,120
OK, well, I’m not going to make you sit
here for the entire thing.. let’s skip ahead!

337
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,170
OK, so this is interesting.

338
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,920
The first thing I notice is that they are
using 40-columns text, which has to be generated

339
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,770
on a bit-mapped screen because the VIC-20
hardware only does 22 columns.

340
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,750
And it’s surprisingly readable.

341
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,540
Keep in mind this is coming from a real VIC-20
computer, not an emulator.

342
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,641
Even these sound effects are impressive because
while the VIC-20 does have 4 voices, they

343
00:20:50,641 --> 00:20:53,990
can only do noise or square wave with no ADSR
envelope.

344
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,890
So they are really manipulating some registers
to get these effects!

345
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,150
OK, so this is the game.

346
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,940
It appears I’m some sort of 3D jelly creature
or something and I’m trapped in a room.

347
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,790
The graphics are very impressive, even though
they are monochrome.

348
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,940
OK, so the door is locked.

349
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,780
So, I guess I have to figure out how to get
out of this room.

350
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:22,340
OK, I eventually determined that jumping on
this grating will get me out.

351
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:29,250
OK, so are these killer smiley faces?

352
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:38,530
I don’t know, either way the animation is
impressive.

353
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:46,960
Well, whatever I did, I died.

354
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,420
Well, this is certainly a game I will need
to spend some more time playing.

355
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,280
It’s actually really impressive for the
hardware it’s running on.

356
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,340
So, for those that are interested, I did put
a link down in the description field for where

357
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,400
you might be able to go purchase a copy of
Pentagorat.

358
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,460
I think you can download it for free if you
want to use it in an emulator.

359
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,270
So anyway, that about wraps it up for this
episode.

360
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:19,230
So, stick around for the next one!
